# destiny_calculator
its all in the name

build with the following on linux:

`gcc -Wall matrix_calculator.c -o test`

run like this to output to a text file called output:

`./test > output`

To use the output file, you can search for a date using a standard text editor. 
The meanings of the numbers, must be related back to a numerology book or website at this stage, its a ot of information to add to a C program. 
The main point of this program is to proceduraly generate a persons life, and all meaningful numbers. 
A numerologist can then use this output to apply meanings into words that one can understand. 
I find it quite accurate to my own life so far. 

Enjoy knowing the future :)
